# How to obtain the default repository owner?
# -------------------------------------------
# 
# 1. extract the name of the owner of the repository your currently standing in
# 2. if that doesn't work, get the locally configured github user as set up in the git repository you're standing in
# 3. if that doesn't work, get the local system globally configured github user
# 4. okay, nothing works. So you must be GerHobbelt on a fresh machine, right?
# 
# Note: the RE is engineered to eat ANYTHING and only extract username from legal git r/w repository URLs (git@github.com:user/repo.git)
# Note: this RE should work with BSD/OSX sed too:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12178924/os-x-sed-e-doesnt-accept-extended-regular-expressions
